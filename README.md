# gestor-de-tareas
Through python, tkinter and using sqlite3 for the database I created a simple task manager, this is the application made with tkinter and python number 4.

This is my fourth application in tkinter with python, it's relatively simple, to run the application just do the following:

1) clone the repository using "git clone plus the repository url"
2) through your terminal enter the folder called gestor-de-tareas
3) Once you have entered the folder via terminal, run the following command: on Windows: python db.py - on macOS: python3 db.py
4) Done! You can now use this simple application
